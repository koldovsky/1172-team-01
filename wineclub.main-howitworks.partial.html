                        The shipping is $1.00 for a Vintage Club member and $10.00 per package for a Luxury Club member. We ship our products via the Fed Ex, GSO, and UPS ground network. The client must be a person of over 21 years of age. If you want to pick up your order, you will not incur this fee. If the order comes back to us, you will pay $8 for reshipping.

                        We will charge $10 for shipping if we send a club order that is flagged for a receipt. We require a written correction of all addresses, cancellation of membership, and credit card 30 days before the next dispatch.

                            You don't have to pay any membership fees for Pinot Noir's wine club. You have to pay only for the club orders. Your credit card on file will be billed 2 weeks in advance of every wine club delivery.

                            After the year of membership, you can cancel at any time you want for free. If you want to cancel before receiving your club shipments for one year, you will pay a $75 cancellation fee.
