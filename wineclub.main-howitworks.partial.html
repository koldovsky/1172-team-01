                        The shipping is $1.00 for a Vintage Club member and $10.00 per package for a Luxury Club member. We ship our products via the Fed Ex, GSO, and UPS ground network. The client must be a person of over 21 years of age. If you want to pick up your order, you will not incur this fee. If the order comes back to us, you will pay $8 for reshipping.

                        We will charge $10 for shipping if we send a club order that is flagged for a receipt. We require a written correction of all addresses, cancellation of membership, and credit card 30 days before the next dispatch.
