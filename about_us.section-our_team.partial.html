                              His urge to get closer to the action led him to Texas where he was
                              inspired by the best winery owners and winemaking professionals
                              while building and managing their wine programs for several local
                              restaurants. Smith decided to deepen his interest in winemaking
                              industry and gained a Certificate in Viticulture from the Santa Rosa
                              Junior College. Next he pursued a degree in Enology, Plant Science,
                              and Chemistry, and gained winemaking experience while also
                              experimenting with his favorite wine in his own backyard project
                              with his wife, Mary. Finally, he embarked upon an extensive search
                              throughout the area for a suitable location to start a commercial
                              vineyard. That was a foundation of the Pinot Noir Winery.
