          It is strongly recommended that you book in advance if you wish to
          attend a wine tasting event. This ensures that you have a place booked
          and means that the event organizers can plan accordingly. Booking in
          advance also means that you can take advantage of any
          <u>discounts or special offers</u>
          that may be available. Our wine tasting events are in high demand and
          it is important to ensure that you are able to attend by booking your
          place in advance.

                    Generally speaking, it is best to dress in smart casual
                    attire. You should avoid wearing open-toed shoes or
                    flip-flops. It is also recommended that you wear layers in
                    case the temperature inside the winery is different than
                    outside.
